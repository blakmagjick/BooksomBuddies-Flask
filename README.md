## User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create a profile, so that I can see what books I own.
- As a user, I want to be able to leave notes on my books, that only I can see, that I can see things like who recommended this book to me, or something a friend told me about the book.
- As a user, I want to be able to add books to a wish list, so that I can easily look at the list while I'm out book shopping.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit my profile, but no one else's.
- As a user, I want to be able to go to the forum and talk to other users about books, so that I can get some ideas of what to read next, and/or talk about what I love/hate about books I've read.
- As a user, I want to be able to easily add books to my profile without manually adding the information myself.
- As a user, I want the app to look pretty and professional.
