- As a user, I want to be able to add books to a wish list, so that I can easily look at the list while I'm out book shopping.
- As a user, I want to be able to edit my profile, but no one else's.
- As a user, I want to be able to go to the forum and talk to other users about books, so that I can get some ideas of what to read next, and/or talk about what I love/hate about books I've read.
